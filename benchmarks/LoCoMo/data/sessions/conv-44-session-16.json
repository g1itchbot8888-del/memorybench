He also showed Audrey a serene photo from his previous hike. Audrey mentioned learning dog grooming, feeling closer to her pups, and shared a picture of them looking cute and fluffy post-grooming. Andrew praised her skills and sought grooming tips, which Audrey gladly provided. They discussed weekend plans - Audrey taking her dogs to the park for a stroll and Andrew heading to a nature reserve. Andrew promised to share photos from his trip with Audrey later. They bid goodbye, looking forward to the pictures and caring for their pets.",
