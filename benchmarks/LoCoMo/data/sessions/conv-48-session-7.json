  "session_summary": "Jolene and Deborah caught up at 4:50 pm on 25 February 2023. Jolene shared how balancing engineering school with her partner's video games is challenging but she finds peace through yoga and meditation. Her partner sometimes joins in, bringing them closer. They've been together for three years since meeting in an engineering class, and their relationship started from a strong friendship. Deborah praised Jolene's progress and encouraged her to continue prioritizing self-care. Deborah, on the other hand, mentioned her morning routine of meditation, yoga, teaching classes, and now a morning jog for self-connection. She highlighted the importance of self-care to help others and emphasized the value of prioritizing oneself. Jolene appreciated Deborah's support and vowed to continue prioritizing self-care.",
