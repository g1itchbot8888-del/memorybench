Yesterday, when we were at the theater, Samantha loves theater, I asked her to become my girlfriend, and she agreed. We have gone through a lot in this short period. There were good and bad, but I'm happy with her. All that ups and downs were a bit overwhelming, but it's part of life. What about you? Anything interesting lately?"
