  "session_summary": "Jolene and Deborah conversed at 7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023. Jolene shared about her challenging but fun robotics project that tests her creativity and problem-solving skills. Deborah praised her and asked about her feelings when she first received the project. Jolene felt a mix of excitement and nerves initially but now enjoys working on it, comparing it to solving a puzzle and finding designing and programming solutions. Deborah met her new neighbor at yoga in the park and they discussed the benefits of yoga in their lives. Jolene mentioned planning to play console games with her partner instead of resuming yoga. Deborah acknowledged the importance of having shared activities with her partner. The conversation ended with Jolene saying goodbye and looking forward to meeting again.",
