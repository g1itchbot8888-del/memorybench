  "session_summary": "Audrey informed Andrew about her dogs' behavior issues, her appointment with an animal behaviorist, and the positive tips she received for handling the problems. The conversation then shifted to planning a nature hike with their furry friends on Saturday, exploring a trail by a lake with scenic views. They expressed excitement and gratitude for the upcoming adventure, sharing photos of potential locations and expressing eagerness to capture memories with their dogs. Andrew shared a photo of his happy dog from a previous hike, and they both looked forward to creating new joyful memories together. They planned to meet for the hike and said their goodbyes as they got ready to head out.",
